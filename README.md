# BuzzWord
BuzzWord is a word game based on Boggle where a user finds words from a 3x3 grid of letters created entirely using JavaFX and Java 8.
This version allows for multiple user profiles and has multiple modes to choose from.

The application utilises the JFLAG Framework which was created by the professors of CSE219 at SBU. It was modified from its original form by me to allow it to be more generic.

The Software Design Description for this project is included.

The original project with all of its commit messages can be seen at this repository: https://bitbucket.org/TejasPrasad219/buzzword
