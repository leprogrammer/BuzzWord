# BuzzWord
BuzzWord is a word game based on Boggle. 

It allows for multiple user profiles and has multiple modes to choose from.

The entire application is created using JavaFX and Java 8.

The JFLAG Framework was created by the professors of CSE219 at SBU. It was modified from its original form by me to allow it to be more generic.


The original project with all of its commit messages can be seen at this repository: https://bitbucket.org/TejasPrasad219/buzzword
